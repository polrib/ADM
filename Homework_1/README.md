# ADM-2018-Group-24-Homework3

This is the repository for the third homework of the course ADM 2018 at Sapienza University. The authors of this repository are: Federica Spoto, Reza Pourrahim, Pol Rib√≥.

In this assignment we perform an analysis of the text of Airbnb property listings. In particular, our objective is to create an appropriate Search Engine to find the perfect house depending on the user's request.

## Data Source
For the analysis, we used the data of the [Airbnb Property Data from Texas](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/airbnb-property-data-from-texas), which contains the information of 18259 accommodations available in Texas.

## Description of the project
In this repository you will find:
1. `Homework_3.ipynb`: 
the Jupyter file contains all the work done in light of the achievement of the final result. Concretely:

  - The creation and visualization of the following files `Dict.txt`, `Inv_Dict.txt`, and its corresponding explanation. 
  
  - The implementation and some examples of queries of the different Search Engines created.
  
  - The definition, implementations and example of the scoring new function. 
  
  - The implementation of the Geomap that searches accomodations according to a location and its radius.
  
2. `map.html`:
this html file, that can be seen [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Rezaprh/ADM-2018-Group-24-HW3/blob/master/map.html), is an example of the application of the last part of the homework. In the example the user provides the coordinates [29.50306, -98.44768] and want to see the available apartments in a distance of 10 km.
